// Excellent use of custom hooks with proper typing
const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

**Test Example:**
```typescript
// Well-structured test with proper mocking
describe('AppointmentService', () => {
  it('should handle appointment creation with proper validation', async () => {
    const mockAppointment = createMockAppointment();
    const result = await appointmentService.create(mockAppointment);
    
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.id).toBeTruthy();
    expect(auditLogger.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('appointment.created');
  });
});
```

  preferences: MatchingPreferences
): MatchScore => {
  const specialtyMatch = calculateSpecialtyAlignment(patient, provider);
  const availabilityMatch = calculateScheduleCompatibility(patient, provider);
  const locationMatch = calculateGeographicProximity(patient, provider);
  
  return {
    overall: weightedAverage([specialtyMatch, availabilityMatch, locationMatch], preferences.weights),
