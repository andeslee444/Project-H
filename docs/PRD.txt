Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Business Problem

Mental health practices frequently experience last-minute patient cancellations, resulting in empty appointment slots. For practices with long waitlists, these cancellations cause revenue loss, provider dissatisfaction, and potential patient attrition. If providers are paid regardless, financial burdens increase for practices. Conversely, if providers are unpaid for empty slots, practices risk provider turnover.

Product Vision

A specialized scheduling and waitlist management app for mental health clinics, streamlining patient-provider matches based on cancellations, preferences, and demographics, significantly reducing appointment gaps and maximizing provider utilization and patient satisfaction.

MVP Core Requirements
