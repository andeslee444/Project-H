# Data Standardization Summary

## Overview
This document describes the data standardization work completed to improve the provider-patient matching system in the waitlist management feature.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Inconsistent JSONB Data Structure
- **Issue**: The `insurance_info` and `preferences` columns had different structures across rows
- **Impact**: Made querying difficult, prevented proper indexing, and could cause runtime errors
- **Example**: 
  - Some rows: `insurance_info.provider`
  - Other rows: `insurance_info.insurance_provider` 
  - Some had detailed info with `memberId`, `groupNumber`, etc.

### 2. Buried Critical Data
- **Issue**: Patient diagnosis was stored inside `preferences.primaryCondition` JSONB field
- **Impact**: Difficult to query, filter, and create indexes for performance

### 3. Simple String Matching
- **Issue**: Provider-patient matching used basic string contains logic
- **Impact**: Missed many valid matches (e.g., "anxiety" wouldn't match "anxious")

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Improvements
Added proper columns to the `patients` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE patients 
ADD COLUMN diagnosis TEXT,
ADD COLUMN insurance_provider TEXT,
ADD COLUMN insurance_member_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN preferred_modality TEXT,
ADD COLUMN preferred_gender TEXT,
ADD COLUMN location VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN photo TEXT;
```

### 2. Data Migration
- Migrated data from JSONB fields to proper columns
- Preserved original JSONB for additional flexible data
- Added defaults for missing values
- Diversified diagnoses to match provider specialties

### 3. Sophisticated Matching Algorithm
Created `providerMatching.ts` with:
- **Comprehensive diagnosis mapping**: Maps related terms (e.g., "anxiety" matches "anxiety disorders", "panic", "stress management")
- **Insurance variation handling**: Recognizes different names for same insurance (e.g., "BCBS" = "Blue Cross Blue Shield")
- **Scoring system**: 
  - Diagnosis match: 40 points
  - Insurance match: 30 points
  - Location match: 20 points
  - Modality preference: 10 points
  - Hand-raised bonus: 20 points
- **Match threshold**: 70+ points = valid match

### 4. Performance Optimizations
Added indexes for commonly queried fields:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_patients_diagnosis ON patients(diagnosis);
CREATE INDEX idx_patients_insurance_provider ON patients(insurance_provider);
CREATE INDEX idx_patients_location ON patients(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_providers_specialties ON providers USING GIN (specialties);
CREATE INDEX idx_providers_insurance ON providers USING GIN (insurance_accepted);
```

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Data Integrity
- Consistent data structure across all rows
- Type safety with proper columns
- Easier to maintain and validate

### 2. Better Performance
- Proper indexes for fast queries
- Direct column access instead of JSONB parsing
- Optimized matching algorithm

### 3. Enhanced Matching Accuracy
- Catches more valid matches with synonym recognition
- Multi-criteria scoring provides nuanced results
- Location-based matching for proximity

### 4. Future-Proof Design
- Easy to add new matching criteria
- JSONB still available for flexible additional data
- Clear separation of core vs. supplementary data

## Test Files
- `test-matching-system.html` - Interactive test of the matching algorithm
- `test-profile-photos.html` - View all provider and patient photos
- `test-supabase-connection.html` - Verify database connection

## Next Steps
1. Monitor matching performance in production
2. Gather feedback on match accuracy
3. Consider adding:
   - Distance calculation based on actual addresses
   - Availability matching
   - Patient preference scoring
   - Provider rating influence
