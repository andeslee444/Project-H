# Supabase Authentication Restoration Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully reverted all mock authentication imports back to the original Supabase authentication system.

### Files Updated

1. **src/App.jsx**
   - Changed: `import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from './hooks/useAuth-mock'` 
   - To: `import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from './hooks/useAuth'`
   - Also updated AuthTest import from `./pages/AuthTestMock` to `./pages/AuthTest`

2. **src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx**
   - Changed: `import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth-mock'`
   - To: `import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth'`

3. **src/components/layouts/Layout/Layout.jsx**
   - Changed: `import { useAuth } from '../../../hooks/useAuth-mock'`
   - To: `import { useAuth } from '../../../hooks/useAuth'`

4. **src/components/layouts/PatientLayout/PatientLayout.jsx**
   - Changed: `import { useAuth } from '../../../hooks/useAuth-mock'`
   - To: `import { useAuth } from '../../../hooks/useAuth'`

5. **src/pages/Providers/ProvidersEnhanced.tsx**
   - Changed: `import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth-mock'`
   - To: `import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'`

6. **src/pages/Providers/ProvidersDebug.tsx**
   - Changed: `import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth-mock'`
   - To: `import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'`

### Files Not Changed

- **src/pages/AuthTestMock.tsx** - This is a specific test file for mock authentication and was left as-is for testing purposes
- **src/pages/Login/Login.jsx** - Already using the correct `useAuth` import
- **src/hooks/useAuth.jsx** - The original Supabase authentication hook
- **src/lib/supabase.js** - Supabase client configuration is intact

### Verification

- All components now use the original Supabase authentication (`useAuth`)
- The Login page is accessible at `/login`
- Supabase client is properly configured with the correct URL and anon key
- The authentication flow includes:
  - Email/password login
  - User profile fetching from the `users` table
  - Role-based access control
  - Session management with auth state listeners

### Next Steps

1. Ensure Supabase backend is running and accessible
2. Test login functionality with valid Supabase credentials
3. Verify that protected routes work correctly with authentication
4. Check that user roles are properly fetched and applied

The app is now ready to work with Supabase authentication again!
