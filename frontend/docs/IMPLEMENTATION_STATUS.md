## Essential Topics Requiring User Input üîî

1. **HIPAA Compliance Validation**
   - Need to know specific compliance requirements
   - External audit requirements?
   - Specific healthcare regulations to follow?

2. **Deployment Environment**
   - Target deployment platform (AWS, Azure, etc.)
   - CDN provider selection
   - Domain and SSL certificate setup

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Email/SMS service provider for notifications
   - Payment processing integration
   - Insurance verification API

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - E2E testing framework preference (Playwright, Cypress)
   - Load testing requirements
   - User acceptance testing process

5. **Component Priorities**
   - Which healthcare-specific components are most critical?
   - Provider scheduling interface details
   - Patient portal features priority

6. **Data Migration**
   - Existing data to migrate?
   - Integration with existing systems?
   - Data retention policies

7. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Preferred analytics platform (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
   - Error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
   - Performance monitoring tools

8. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Business Associate Agreement (BAA) requirements
   - Privacy policy and terms of service
   - Employee training materials

## Recommendations for Next Steps üöÄ

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Complete E2E testing setup
   - Perform security audit
   - Complete remaining UI components

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - Achieve 90% test coverage
   - Complete provider dashboard
   - Implement appointment booking flow

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - HIPAA compliance certification
   - Performance optimization
   - Multi-tenant support

## Technical Debt Notes üìù

1. **Testing Issues**
   - 62 tests still failing (mostly React-specific issues)
   - Need to resolve "Should not already be working" errors
   - Mock data needs to be more comprehensive

2. **Component Completion**
   - Several components have TypeScript types but no implementation
   - Storybook stories needed for more components
   - Mobile-specific components not implemented

3. **Performance**
   - Bundle size can be further optimized
   - Lazy loading not fully implemented
   - Image optimization needed

4. **Security**
   - Need penetration testing
   - Security headers need production testing
   - API rate limiting needs fine-tuning
