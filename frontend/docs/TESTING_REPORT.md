- Time to Interactive: < 5s (target met)
- Bundle Size: 450KB gzipped (needs optimization)
- API Response Times: Monitored

#### Needed:
- Load testing with 1000+ concurrent users
- Stress testing for appointment booking
- Database query optimization verification

### 6. Security Testing

**Status**: ❌ Formal audit pending

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ CSRF tokens
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting

#### Pending:
- ❌ Penetration testing
- ❌ OWASP compliance audit
- ❌ Third-party security review
- ❌ HIPAA compliance certification

## Test Execution

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# All tests
npm run test:all
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
Test Pipeline:
1. Linting & Type Checking
2. Unit Tests (parallel)
3. Integration Tests
4. Build Application
5. E2E Tests (matrix: 3 browsers)
6. Accessibility Audit
7. Performance Budget Check
```

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. **Unit Test Failures**: 62 tests failing
   - Impact: Cannot achieve 90% coverage goal
   - Plan: Fix TypeScript issues, update mocks

2. **Security Audit**: Not completed
   - Impact: HIPAA compliance not verified
   - Plan: Schedule third-party audit

### High Priority
1. **Load Testing**: Not implemented
   - Impact: Unknown performance under load
   - Plan: Implement with k6 or Artillery

2. **Mobile E2E Tests**: Limited coverage
   - Impact: Mobile experience not fully validated
   - Plan: Expand mobile-specific test scenarios

### Medium Priority
1. **Test Data Management**: Manual setup required
   - Impact: Slower test development
   - Plan: Implement test data factories

2. **Visual Regression**: Not implemented
   - Impact: UI changes not automatically detected
   - Plan: Add Percy or Chromatic

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix failing unit tests** (2-3 days)
   - Update mock data types
   - Fix React testing issues
   - Resolve TypeScript errors

2. **Schedule security audit** (1 week)
   - Contact security firm
   - Prepare documentation
   - Plan remediation time

3. **Implement load testing** (3-5 days)
   - Set up k6 or Artillery
   - Define performance criteria
   - Create load test scenarios

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Achieve 90% unit test coverage
2. Complete mobile E2E test suite
3. Implement visual regression testing
4. Create test data management system

### Long-term (1 month)
1. Complete HIPAA compliance certification
2. Implement continuous security scanning
3. Establish performance budgets
4. Create chaos engineering tests

## Test Metrics Dashboard

### Current Week
- Tests Run: 1,245
- Pass Rate: 83%
- Average Duration: 12m 30s
- Flaky Tests: 3

### Coverage Trends
```
Week 1: 65% → Week 2: 70% → Week 3: 75% → Current: 78%
Target: 90% by end of sprint
```

### E2E Test Performance
- Average Run Time: 8m 45s
- Parallel Execution: 4 workers
- Browser Matrix: 3 browsers
- Success Rate: 98%

## Conclusion

The testing infrastructure is largely in place with comprehensive E2E testing now implemented. The main gaps are:

1. **Unit test failures** preventing coverage goals
2. **Security audit** for HIPAA compliance
3. **Load testing** for performance validation

With focused effort on these areas, the application can achieve production-ready testing standards within 2-3 weeks.
